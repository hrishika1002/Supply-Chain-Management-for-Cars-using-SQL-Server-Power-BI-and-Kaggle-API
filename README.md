Supply-Chain-Management-Dashboard-Power-BI
Project Description

Supply Chain Management for Cars is an interactive Power BI Dashboard built using Python, MS SQL Server, and Kaggle API. It provides end-to-end visibility of the automotive supply chain, covering materials, orders, sales, and customer demand across suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and customers.

The project integrates data engineering, analytics, and visualization to optimize operations, reduce costs, and improve delivery efficiency.

Problem Statement

The automotive supply chain is highly complex, involving multiple stakeholders and processes. Automakers often face challenges such as siloed data, lack of visibility, and difficulty analyzing key metrics like inventory levels, order fulfillment, and supplier performance.

This project resolves these challenges by creating a centralized and data-driven dashboard for better tracking and decision-making.
